  - `--help` / `-h`: Comprehensive help documentation

- **Progress Indicators**: 
  - 6-step progress tracking with visual progress bars
  - Spinner animations during key generation
  - Step-by-step completion markers
  - Time tracking and duration reporting

- **Enhanced User Prompts**:
  - Interactive key rotation decision with detailed information
  - Educational prompts explaining security benefits
  - Multi-option responses (Y/n/info) with help text
  - Clear action confirmations

- **Professional Output Formatting**:
  - Unicode box drawing for headers and summaries
